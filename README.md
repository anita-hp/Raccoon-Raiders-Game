# Raccoon-Raiders-Game
Raccoon Raiders is a game similar to Rodent's Revenge. During the game, raccoons try to climb into one of the available garbage cans. The main player aims to prevent the raccoons from reaching the garbage cans by trapping them using recycling bins.
When the game starts, the player is placed on the top-left corner. Raccoons, garbage cans and recycling bins are placed randomly on the board. Two types of raccoons exist in the game: regular raccoons and smart raccoons (with glasses), that move randomly or smartly respectively, aiming to crawl inside the garbage cans.
When a raccoon reaches an unoccupied, unlocked garbage can, it crawls inside and stays there. If the garbage can is locked, the raccoon will use up its turn to unlock it.
The game ends once all raccoons are either trapped or inside garbage cans.
